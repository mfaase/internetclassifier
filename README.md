# internetclassifier
A set of fucntions that will search images of strings found in a users' document, and allows the user to categorize these based on the image shown. 
Used for building datasets for image classifiers.

Typically, feed a .txt file to indexed_list_init.py first to create a memoryfile.

Then you can itemcategorizer.py to start labelling strings based on images shown. 

If you want to add more strings to your original txt file, you can use uniquetxt.py to merge strings without duplicates.
